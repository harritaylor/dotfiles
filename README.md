## Install

If you want to use this yourself, please check and modify `setup.sh`, `gitconfig`, and `vimrc`, as they contain lines that are suited to my particular setup.

1. Clone this repo
	* It helps to keep it in a logical place. I personally use reverse domains to keep everything organised (e.g. `~/git/github.com/harritaylor/dotfiles`)
1. Install by running `. ./setup.sh` in the root folder.
	* This sets up all the symlinks to keep everything centralised.
